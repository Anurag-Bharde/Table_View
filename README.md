# React Crop Data Aggregation

A React project to aggregate and display crop data in tabular form with multiple views.

---

## 🛠 How I Did It

1. **Created React Components**:
   - Used `useState` for managing table view state.
   - Added reusable functions to aggregate and transform data.
   
2. **Used Mantine Library**:
   - Styled buttons and tables.
   - Ensured responsiveness.

3. **Data Manipulation**:
   - Used `Array.reduce()` to process and aggregate crop data.

## 🚀 How It Works

### Data Aggregation
1. **Maximum/Minimum Production**:
   - Groups data by year.
   - Identifies the crop with the maximum and minimum production for each year.
   
2. **Average Yield & Area**:
   - Groups data by crop name.
   - Calculates the average yield and cultivation area for each crop over the years.

### Components
- **Buttons**: To switch between table views (`A`, `B`, or `Reset`).
- **Table**: Dynamically displays the appropriate data based on the selected view.
